## Trading Philosophy

Trading with money management best practices.

## Thinking About Exit Strategy First

Getting into a trade is easy, knowing when to get out is the hard part. Autonomous trading means you never have to second-guess your exit strategy again.

Project Paja creates three orders per trading transaction which adds a sophisticated layer to the trading strategy. 

* `Capture quick wins`: Seize fleeting market opportunities with agile market buys.

* `Minimize downside risk`: Protect your capital with swift exits triggered by the 1% stop-loss.

* `Lock in consistent profits`: Secure gains when the market moves in your favor with the 3% take-profit order.

## Money Management As A Service

Every transaction trigger unleashes three strategically-placed orders:

* `Market Buy`: Project Paja seizes the opportunity at the current market price, capitalizing on identified trends.

* `1% Stop-Loss Sell`: A safety net is woven in. If the price dips 1% below the entry point, Project Paja automatically exits, protecting your gains and limiting potential losses.

* `3% Take-Profit Sell`: Greed is good, but knowing when to cash out is better. Once the price climbs 3% above the entry point, Project Paja secures those profits by triggering a sell, leaving you with realized profits.
