## What's in commons-math

Commons Math is made up of a small set of math/stat utilities addressing programming problems like the ones in the list below. This list is not exhaustive, it's just meant to give a feel for the kinds of things that Commons Math provides.

    Computing means, variances and other summary statistics for a list of numbers
    Fitting a line to a set of data points using linear regression
    Fitting a curve to a set of data points
    Finding a smooth curve that passes through a collection of points (interpolation)
    Fitting a parametric model to a set of measurements using least-squares methods
    Solving equations involving real-valued functions (i.e. root-finding)
    Solving systems of linear equations
    Solving Ordinary Differential Equations
    Minimizing multi-dimensional functions
    Generating random numbers with more restrictions (e.g distribution, range) than what is possible using the JDK
    Generating random samples and/or datasets that are "like" the data in an input file
    Performing statistical significance tests
    Miscellaneous mathematical functions such as factorials, binomial coefficients and "special functions" (e.g. gamma, beta functions)
